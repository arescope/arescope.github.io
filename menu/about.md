Hi there! I'm Alberto. I am a Geek, I love what I do and I do what I love. Supercharged about tech, never say no to anything tech-y. Always prefer to try-and-fail (if it does fail) rather than not-try-and-regret-later.

During my 10+ years of career, I have been through different environments and situations - from doing consultation at the beginning of my career to actually building a startup now. After the amazing experience of working at CERN for 5 years, I relocated to Singapore where I have been part of the vibrant startup scene for more than 3 years.

My objective as Engineer : Go with the entire Engineering Team to Bali for a monthâ€™s worth of vacation, and automation takes care of everything.

My favourite word: FOCUS. It is what any Engineer needs. Focus on what is worth and go for it without regrets.

My favourite sentence: DO THE RIGHT THING. You can do lot of things, but do it right.
